Firey's Candy Bar Adventure 2 is a fanmade sequel to the classic 2009 title "Firey's Candy Bar Adventure", created by Michael and Cary Huang, the same creators who created BFDI. I like BFDI btw. This game is still in development, so everthing here is subject to change.

Here you start as Firey, the main character of the original game. Your goal is to collect candy bars scattered across various levels while avoiding obstacles and enemies.
